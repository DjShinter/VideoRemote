# Video Remote Mod

This is a **MelonLoader** Mod for **ChilloutVR**, 
The **Video Remote mod** adds QOL changes to **ChilloutVR** to have an easier time to do certain functions to VideoPlayers while in VR & Desktop.

### Main features


-  Controls for VideoPlayers in the world
	- Shows currently playing video name
	- Play, Pause, Adjust volume
	- Paste video URLs from Clipboard
	- Change permission between 'Everyone' and 'Instance Moderators' 
	- Network Sync Toggle
	- Audio Source switch between, 'Audio Source', 'Room Scale', 'Direct' (2D) 
	- Reload current video at current timestamp. (Useful for Prop video players, so you can reload the current video for late joiners)
- SponsorBlock's API integration for auto skipping sponsor segments and more! 
   - > [SponsorBlock ](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)is web browser extension for Youtube which has public API for adding to other platforms
   - This requires you to select the desired video player and in the 'SponsorBlock' menu toggle it to 'Enabled'.  After a moment the menu will populate with any found events from the API and if any of the options are enabled under  'Segments types to skip', the mod will automatically skip past them once the segment is reached. 
 - Save/Load URLs from a file
 - Local Video player Screen
	 - Most useful when the video player in a world is in an inconvenient spot, or you just want to lay back and still watch. 
	 - Includes options to adjust the size and toggle pickup.

§7.1 You may only create modifications for the purpose of improving the game. Malicious mods are not permitted and will be punished in any case we deem it necessary to take action on. ✅

§7.2 If you plan on publishing your mods to the workshop you must release the mods sourcecode to the public (for example by using github). This does not affect mods hosted on third party platforms directly, that are not released to the workshop. ✅

§7.3 Publishing obfuscated mods to the workshop is not allowed. ✅

§7.4 If you have to overwrite, alter or include base game scripts with your mod, you have to request appropriate permission before releasing it to the public. In this case we also require you to include a disclaimer that the base code of the game is owned by us. This may be a simple one-liner. ✅

§7.5 When releasing mods to the public, it is required to state, that the mod authors and modification are in no affiliation with ABI and not supported by ABI. ✅
